# Various-MLP-architectures-for-MNIST-dataset
Implement various MLP architectures by varying the number of hidden layers, adding and removing Dropouts and Batch Normalization to observe the model performance

## Data
Data can be found here at <a href = "https://keras.io/datasets/#mnist-database-of-handwritten-digits"> Keras datasets </a>.

## Data Overview
MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of the 10 digits, along with a test set of 10,000 images.
